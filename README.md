 Objectives:
 
  In the Austin American Statemen released several reports describing racial disparities in Texas. In order to confirm whether this was  true I used a test that measures disparities in police search rates called the benchmark test. The goal of this visualization is to aide in determining whether the benchmark test shows discrimination in the various counties of Texas. For this visualization our clients would be the reporters at the Austin American Statesmen, the Texas Police Department, as well as any concerned citizens of Texas. The dataset of this project is a subset of the Stanford Open Policing Project dataset that is based on Texas and contains the search rate of every race in each of the counties. We would like to determine the discribution of police searches across racial groups in the counties and try to view if there are any trends.

Since the data we are comparing our quantitative we used points as our mark. The channel is the size and the color of the points. The size represents the number of minorities searched in the county and the color represents which minority group we are looking at.


Data set
  - Texas County json File
  - Stanford Open Police Project

Description and Outcomes:

The scatter plot would show clearly how many counties are discraminate against white but it's dificult to tell where and what counties. Therefore, the highlighiting on map shows where the county is and Tooltip shows the name of county and the number of searched. Morevoer, the Map showing statistical answer of what counties are abnormal in terms of difference search rate for between minority and white drivers.
