      <h5>Visualization Discussion</h5>
      In the Austin American Statemen released several reports describing
      racial disparities in Texas. In order to confirm whether this was true I used
      a test that measures disparities in police search rates called the benchmark test.
      The goal of this visualization is to aide in determining whether the benchmark
      test shows discrimination in the various counties of Texas. For this visualization
      our clients would be the reporters at the Austin American Statesmen, the Texas
      Police Department, as well as any concerned citizens of Texas. The dataset
      of this project is a subset of the Stanford Open Policing Project dataset that is
      based on Texas and contains the search rate of every race in each of the counties.
       We would like to determine the discribution of police searches across racial groups
       in the counties and try to view if there are any trends.<br/><br/>
       Since the data we are comparing our quantitative we used points as our mark.
        The channel is the size and the color of the points. The size represents
        the number of minorities searched in the county and the color represents
        which minority group we are looking at.
